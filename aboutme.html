        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jacob Hoefer. Fresh out of a coding intensive at Rutgers I am eager to start coding in the
            professional world. Once baker, wanna be film student, and history major now with a coding certificate there
            is very little I am interested in learning. I am now well versed in every process of development. From HTML,
            css, js, React, photoshop, Davinci video editing, indesign, all things you need to make and publish content
            from the ground up. Reachout in the 
            <a href="./contact.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" style="color: aliceblue;">contact me</a>
            page and click around the site! This was all coded from
            scratch by yours truly. <a href="./index.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" style="color: aliceblue;">Head Home</a></p>
